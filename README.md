## üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Tom Delahaye

I am a Master‚Äôs student (M1) specializing in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at ESILV, currently pursuing a Research Track with a project centered on *Unsupervised Deep Learning for Information Retrieval of Long Documents*. Passionate about data analysis, machine learning, and innovation, I leverage AI techniques for real-world applications, particularly in fraud detection, optimization, and predictive analytics.


## üõ†Ô∏è Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL, C#, R
- **Data Analysis**: Expert in libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning**: Experience with supervised and unsupervised learning, including popular models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Data Science**: Skilled in feature engineering, statistical analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Sweetviz
- **Deep Learning**:
  - Proficient in **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**
  - Experienced with neural network architectures such as **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, and transformer-based models (e.g., **BERT**, **GPT**)
- **LLM (Large Language Models)**:
  - Skilled in building LLM pipelines using **LangChain** for orchestration of complex workflows
  - Experience with **OpenAI API**, **Chroma**, and **FAISS** for efficient information retrieval and response generation
  - Developed chatbots and document analysis systems leveraging **GPT models** and integrated tools like **EasyOCR** for text extraction


## üìö Recent Projects

- **Fraud Detection System**: Developed a fraud detection model using machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, SVM, and KNN, combined with SMOTE for imbalanced data handling.
- **Biscuit Optimization**: Implemented an optimization algorithm for a biscuit manufacturing process, maximizing profit while reducing waste using Python-based heuristics.
- **Movie Recommendation System**: Built a collaborative filtering recommendation system using KNN and SVD to predict user preferences based on historical data.
- **Social Rights Assistant Chatbot**: Created a chatbot leveraging OpenAI's API for answering HR and social rights questions, integrating document embeddings with Chroma for enhanced search capabilities.
